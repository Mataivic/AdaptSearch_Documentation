Overview
========

codeml is a part of the PAML package, which is a suite of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA or protein sequences using maximum likelihood (ML).

codeml carries out ML analysis of :

 #. protein-coding DNA sequences using codon substitution models (e.g., Goldman and Yang 1994)
 #. amino acid sequences under a number of amino acid substitution models.

The most important parameters are the model choices, 'branch model' and 'Site model'. The two of them can be combined to run mixed models.

.. warning:: Incompatibilities between modesl are automatically excluded from the selection, but some can remain (we haven't tested everything yet)!

.. note:: Don't forget to set the 'Sequences format in the fasta file' advanced parameter according to the format of your alignement ! The AdaptSearch suite is configured to run with nucleic format by default, but it is still possible to perform analyses on proteic data (the tool CDS_Search can return proteic sequences, and ConcatPhyl can handle them)
