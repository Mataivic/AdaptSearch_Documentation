Overview
========

TransDecoder identifies candidate coding regions within transcript sequences, such as those generated by de novo RNA-Seq transcript assembly using Trinity, or constructed based on RNA-Seq alignments to the genome using Tophat and Cufflinks.

TransDecoder identifies likely coding sequences based on the following criteria:

 #. a minimum length open reading frame (ORF) is found in a transcript sequence
 #. a log-likelihood score similar to what is computed by the GeneID software is > 0.
 #. the above coding score is greatest when the ORF is scored in the 1st reading frame as compared to scores in the other 5 reading frames.
 #. if a candidate ORF is found fully encapsulated by the coordinates of another candidate ORF, the longer one is reported. However, a single transcript can report multiple ORFs (allowing for operons, chimeras, etc).
 #. optional the putative peptide has a match to a Pfam domain above the noise cutoff score.


User parameters
===============

 * Transcripts : all the transciriptoms fasta files (one per species)
 * Minimum protein length : the minimum length of the open reading frame
 * Advanced options

  - Strand-specific : Check 'Yes' to analyze top strand only (default : No)
  - Genetic code : choose a specific geentic-code (default : universal)
  - Shorten potential 5' partials if they are this percentage of the original protein or longer : 5' partials longer than the specified percentage will be eliminated (default : deactivated)
  - Retain long ORfs : only return ORFs equal or longer than the specified length (default : 900)
  - Retain only the single best ORF per transcript (default : No) ; if 'Yes', only one ORF per transcript will be returned

 * Markov training options
 
  - Training method : choose between training with the top longest ORFs (default : the 500 longest) or with a set of known ORFs (fasta file)
