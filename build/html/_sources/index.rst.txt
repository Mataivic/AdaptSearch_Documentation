Welcome to AdaptSearch's documentation!
=======================================

.. topic:: The AdaptSearch Pipeline

   AdaptSearch is dedicated to the search of selection within branches and sites of phylogenetic trees built from groups of orthologous genes. The first tools proceeds to data filtering and building of genes groups, while the second part proceeds to phylogeny building (using RAxML) and selection detection (codeML).
